2. Translate them into English (if they are Japanese)
3. Get the tweets in your (or someone's) list.
4. Translate them into English (if they are Japanese)
5. With the tweets by you, score each tweet in the list.
6. Show high score tweets, which would be interesting to you.

For 1. and 3., to get tweets, the program uses lxml.
So, you need to install lxml for running this program

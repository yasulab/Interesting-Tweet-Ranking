Description
-----------

This is a program that finds interesting tweets for you.
Given your (or someone's) twitter account and twitter list
with its owner, the program finds interesting tweets from
the list for you (or for someone).

The program includes a function that translates Japanese into
English, so Japanese and English users can use this program.

This program finds the interesting tweets in the follwoing ways:

1. Get recent tweets by you.
2. Translate them into English (if they are Japanese)
3. Get the tweets in your (or someone's) list.
4. Translate them into English (if they are Japanese)
5. With the tweets by you, score each tweet in the list.
6. Show high score tweets, which would be interesting to you.

For 1. and 3., to get tweets, the program uses lxml.
So, you need to install lxml for running this program

For 2. and 4., this program uses Google Translate API.
The API has limited number of use. So, if the program returns,
HTTP Error 403, it means you exceeded the number of use.

For 5. and 6., this program assumes that you will be interested
in the tweets that has similar words you recently tweets.

In other words, your recent tweets are used as training data,
and with the result of training, score each tweet in the list.
So, if a tweet has a high score, it means that it might be the
tweet you are interested in because the tweet includes
similar words to what you recently tweeted.
